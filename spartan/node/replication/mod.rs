//!
//! This schema describes order, in which messages are sent between primary and replica nodes.
//!
//! Primary is on the left and always sends messages first, while replica node is on the right, and only responds to them.
//!
//! # Messages
//!
//! ## Ping and Pong
//!
//! These messages are used to check, if all replicas are still online.
//!
//! While just the TCP ping can be used, it's better to check if replica has the same replication protocol as primary.
//!
//! ## AskIndex and RecvIndex
//!
//! After we check replica health, we need to ask about last received index of each queue.
//!
//! Replica sends back RecvIndex message, that contains data about available queues and their indexes.
//!
//! ## SendRange and RecvRange (and probably QueueNotFound)
//!
//! With `queue = index` array of each replica available, primary node takes new events from event log of each queue, and sends it to replica.
//!
//! Replica responds with either RecvRange in case if everything is OK, or with QueueNotFound in case if primary node sent queue, that doesn't exist.
